No clear statements from the company or exchanges were found.\n\nYHC: Unable to Determine | Reasoning:  Similar to BMRA, a lack of readily available information on YHC's handling of fractional shares following the reverse split prevents a definitive classification.\n\nSUNE: Unable to Determine | Reasoning: While previous SUNE reverse splits may have had specific handling, information regarding the handling of fractional shares for the 2025-04-21 split is not readily available through standard search methods.\n\nHOLO: Unable to Determine | Reasoning:  No specific information on HOLO's fractional share policy for this reverse split could be located using standard search methods.\n\nSEPSF: Unable to Determine | Reasoning:  Information regarding the handling of fractional shares for SEPSF's reverse split is not publicly available through standard search methods.\n\nKZIA: Unable to Determine | Reasoning:  Standard searches did not reveal information on KZIA's policy for handling fractional shares resulting from the reverse split.\n\nIPOO: Unable to Determine | Reasoning:  No information on IPOOF's policy for handling fractional shares from this reverse split was found using standard search methods.\n"}
